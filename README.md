# NEAR Rust Collection Examples using `near-sdk-rs`

This repository serves to demonstrate differences in gas consumption when storing or retrieving data from the NEAR blockchain. This repo will store and retrieve data using Rust collection methods found in [`near-sdk-rs`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs).

## Prerequisites

- Current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). >=v14.0.0
- [NEAR `testnet` account](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/)
- [`near-cli`](https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli#setup) - command line interface to interact with the NEAR blockchain
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Setup

1) Install dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

2) Store your access keys locally

    If you do not already have keys stored locally, run:

    ```bash
    near login
    ```

    You will be redirected to [NEAR `testnet` wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/) to authorize `near cli`. Once permission is granted, you will have a full access key stored as a `.json` file in `~/.near-credentials`. _For non macOS / Linux users, this "hidden" folder is located in the root of your HOME directory.

3) Update `contractName` in `.utils.js`

    Navigate to `services/utils.js` and replace the value for `contractName` to that of the `accountId` you have stored locally.

4) Create a subaccount to deploy a smart contract to

    For this example we will create a subaccount that we can deploy a smart contract to. This repo contains a script that allows us to delete and recreate this sub account to reset _all_ of the data already stored in the contract.

    To create this subaccount run:

    ```bash
    yarn create-account
    ```

5) Deploy your smart contract

    A `.wasm` file is already compiled for you and ready to deploy. To do so, simply run:

    ```bash
    yarn deploy
    ```

    You can view the source code of this deployed contract by navigating to `smart-contract/lib.rs`

### Storing Data

Open `setData.js` in your local IDE and select the number of records you would like to add to the three collection examples. You can do so by changing the number passed to `getDataSet()` at the bottom of this file.

To run the script, type the following in your terminal:

```bash
node setData.js
```

The Node script will start to run console logging `gas_burnt`, `responseTime`, and the current key of the data stored. Once complete, a chart will automatically launch showing you your results. At anytime you can view the chart progress by manually running:

```bash
yarn setcharts
```

### Retrieving Data

Open `getData.js` and make sure the number passed to `getData()` is the same number of values you just added. Once verified, run:

```bash
node getData.js
```

Again, the script will start running returning `gas_burnt`, `responseTime` and the current key of the data retrieved. Once complete, a chart will automatically launch showing you your results. At anytime you can view the chart progress by manually running:

```bash
yarn getcharts
```

### View Example Results

This process can take some time, depending on the amount of records you decide to add. If you would like to see what some example results look like right away, run the following to see example `setData()` results:

```bash
yarn exsetcharts
```

For example `getData()` results, run:

```bash
yarn exxgetcharts
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Advisory

Sometimes, with large data amounts you may run into `BadGateway` or `Transaction has expired`. If this happens try lowering the number of values you are entering, or rebuilding the contract by running:

```bash
yarn rebuild
```
